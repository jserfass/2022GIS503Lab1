		<h1>Peaks of the Pacific Northwest</h1>
		<h2>As seen during my adventures around the region</h2>
		<p>  During my 5 years living in Washington State, I have been fortunate enough to climb 111
			 peaks of varying sizes and difficulties throughout the Pacific Northwest region.
			 With the region full of large, isolated mountains characterized by dramatic relief over the nearby
			 landscape (i.e. giant volcanoes), there is ample opportunity for bagging peaks with prominence
			 that exceeds 2,000 feet. This website highlights ascents of peaks in Oregon
			 and Washington with greater than 2,000 feet of prominence by showcasing some of the photos I took during my ascents.
		 </p>
		 <div style="text-align:center;">
		 <p1>  *I have ascents of 17 Washington peaks with over 2,000 feet of prominence. I selected 3 of my favorites for the purposes of this exercise.*
